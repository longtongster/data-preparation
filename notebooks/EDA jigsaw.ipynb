Anyway, I'm not intending to write anything in the article(wow they would jump on me for vandalism), I'm merely requesting that it be more encyclopedic so one can use it for school as a reference. I have been to the selective breeding page but it's almost a stub. It points to 'animal breeding' which is a short messy article that gives you no info.

This is not clear to me in the article. If the ‘’in nomines’’ are based on the plainchant, then where does Taverner come into it? Your expertise would be most appreciated, and maybe the article requires some explanation to this effect.  \n",
